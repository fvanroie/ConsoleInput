With this library you can create an interactive command prompt experience, similar to a shell. You can connect it your MCU and type commands.
The prompt is updated on-the-fly and the program is not blocked waiting for key presses. Special keys like HOME, END, function keys, ESC...
are also recognozed and can be handled in your program is required.

A callback routine can be set which will execute when ENTER/RETURN is pressed, so you can parse and handle the user input.
Check out the example in the examples folder.
